## Introduction

Sidestep this issue by utilizing implicit, likelihood-free methods, in particular, a generative adversar- ial network (GAN) that we adapt to work directly on graph representations. We further utilize a reinforcement learning (RL) objective similar to ORGAN (Guimaraes et al., 2017) to encourage the generation of molecules with particular properties.

## Background

#### **Molecular graph**

Undirected graph G with a set of edges $\xi$ and nodes $V$ .

- Each atoms correspond to a node $v_i \in V$ that is associated with a T-dimensional one-hot vector $x_i$
- Represent Atomic bond as an edge $(v_i,v_j)\in \xi$ associate with a bond type $y\in $ {$1,...,Y$}

For molecular graph with N nodes

Node feature matrix $X=[X_1,...,X_N]^T\in R^{N\times T}$

Adjacency tensor $A\in R^{N\times N\times Y}$ where $A_{ij}\in R^Y$ is a one-hot vector indicating the type of edge between $i$ and $j$.

#### **Generative adversarial networks**

1. Generative model $G_\theta$, learns a map from a prior to the data distribution to sample new data-points.
2. Discriminative model $D_\phi$, learns to classify whether samples came from the distribution rather than from $G_\theta$.

Those two models are implemented as neural networks and trained simultaneously with stochastic gradient descent (SGD).
$$
\min_{\theta} \max_{\phi} \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}(x)} [\log D_{\phi}(x)] + \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z(z)} [\log (1 - D_{\phi}(G_{\theta}(z)))]
$$
where $G_\theta$ tries to generate samples to fool the discriminator and $D_\phi$ tries to differentiate samples correctly. 

## Model

Components: a generator $G_\theta$ , a discriminator $D_\phi$ , and a reward network $\hat{R}_\psi$

The reward network is used to approximate the reward function of a sample and optimize molecule generation to- wards non-differentiable metrics using reinforcement learning.

#### **<u>Input of the model</u>**

- Generator: $z \sim p_z(z)$ , A noise vector  z  sampled from a prior distribution  $p_z(z)$ .
- Discriminator: $x\sim P_{data}(x)$ and $G_\theta(z)$
- Reward network: Dataset and generated samples are inputs of $R^\psi$ ,different from discriminator, it assign scores to the molecular graph (e.g., to be easily synthesizable) by RDkit.

#### **Generator**

​					$z\in R^D$ and $z \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I) $

​					$z\longrightarrow G_\theta \longrightarrow\left\{\begin{aligned}&X\in R^{N\times T}\\&A^{N\times N\times Y}\end{aligned}\right.$

Because both X and A have a probabilistic interpretation since each node and edge type is represented with probabilities of categorical distributions over types. To generate a molecule we obtain discrete, sparse objects $\tilde{X}$ and $\tilde{A}$ via categorical sampling from X and A, respectively. We overload notation and also represent samples from the dataset with binary  $\tilde{X}$ and $\tilde{A}$.

As this discretization process is non-differentiable(Two strategies):

i.Use continuous $X$ and $A$ directly during the forward pass.

ii. Add Gumbel noise to $X,A$ before passing to $D_\phi$ and $\hat{R}_\psi$.

​	i.e. 	$\tilde{X_{ij}}=X_{ij}+Gum(\mu=0,\beta=1)$,

​			$\tilde{A_{ijy}}=A_{ijy}+Gum(\mu=0,\beta=1)$

iii. Use a straightthrough gradient based on categorical reparameterization with the Gum-softmax.[1](ref1)

​			i.e. $\tilde{X_i}=Cat(X_i),\tilde{A_{ij}=Cat(A_{ij})}$

#### Discriminator and reward network

Both the discriminator $D_\phi$ and the reward network $R^\psi$ receive a graph as input, and they output a scalar value each.

A series of graph convolution layers convolve node signals $\tilde{X}$ using the graph adjacency tensor $\tilde{A}$. At every layer, feature representations of nodes are convolved/propagated according to:
$$
&h_i^{\prime (l+1)}=f_s^{(l)}(h_i^{(l)},x_i)+\sum_{j=1}^N \sum_{y=1}^Y \frac{\tilde{A}_{ijy}}{\mathcal{N}_i}f_y^{(l)}(h_j^{(l)},x_j),\\
&h_i^{(l+1)}=\tanh(h_i^{\prime (l+1)})
$$
Where:

- $h_i^{(l)}$ is the signal of the node $i$ at layer $l$.
- $f_s^{(l)}$ is a linear transformation function that acts as a self connection between layers.
- $f_y^{(l)}$ an edge type-specific affine function for each layer.
- $\mathcal{N}_i$ denotes the set of neighbors for node $i$.



After several layers of propagation via graph convolutions, we can aggregate node embeddings into a graph level representation vector as:
$$
h^\prime_\mathcal{G}=\sum_{v\in\mathcal{V}}\sigma(i(h_v^{(L)},x_v))\odot \tanh(j(h_v^{(L)},x_v)),\\
h_{\mathcal{G}}=\tanh h^\prime_{\mathcal{G}}
$$
Where:

- $\sigma(x)=1/(1+exp(-x))\text{ is the logistic sigmoid function.}$
- $i\text{ and }j$ are MLPs with a linear output layer.
- $\odot$ denotes element-wise multiplication.
- $h_{\mathcal{G}}$ is a vector representation of graph $\mathcal{G}$ and it is further processed by an MLP to produce a graph level scalar output $\in(-\infin,+\infin)$ for the discriminator and $\in (0,1)$ for the reward network.

## Additional information

**Hadamard product(Element-wise multiplication)**

For two matrices A and B of the same dimension $m\times n$, the Hadamard product $A\odot B$  is a matrix of the same dimension as the operands.

$(A\odot B)_{ij}=(A)_{ij}(B)_{ij}$
